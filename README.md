# Attention 
if you want to run in your own machine do not forget to add env variable for REACT_APP_KEY in index.tsx file for `firebase config` object
i'am as the dev still can't fix 2 little bug in add note and update note but because it's not break the flow of the app so maybe sometimes i or maybe `YOU` will help me to fix it. If you really want to help me you can do pull req or asking to me first what the bug is about. Thank you for read this

# How long this project done?

# What is this project
this is a project about auth and CRUD app that inspired from yt video about react-firebase with indonesian languange

# what special this project?
even though i know react have redux as global state management, i still don't really understand why we really need redux so i try to create this one of my serious project to learn more about why we need redux instead of useState that deliver with prop, small note that i already try redux before in `sinode-firebase` github
