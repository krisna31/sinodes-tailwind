# What is this project
this is a project about auth and CRUD app that inspired from yt video about react-firebase with indonesian languange

# what special this project?
even though i know react have redux as global state management, i still don't really understand why we really need redux so i try to create this one of my serious project to learn more about why we need redux instead of useState that deliver with prop, small note that i already try redux before in `sinode-firebase` github

# Want Try?
just run `git clone https://github.com/krisna31/sinodes-tailwind`\
then `cd sinodes-tailwind`\
next `npm i`\
continue `npm run start`

# Or Live Demo in
